* Spatial Filtering projects:-
	1) Scaling intensity to be in a specific range [umin, umax] 									(done)
	2) Using kernels and the differences between convolution and correlation.						(done) 
 	3) Standarize the intensity value to be of mean 0 and var 1.									
	4) Hiostogram equalization as a preprocessing step. 											(done)
	4-a)Use Box, gaussian kernel.																	(done only Gaussian)
	5) Using sobel operator(don't forget to rotate it) to approximate first derivative which estimate edge locations. Also, don't forget to scale the intensity to be in [0, 255] because sum of kernel is 0.																		   (done)		
	6) Do the laplacian kernel( symmetric kernel no rotation by 180deg).							(done)
	6-a) Don't forget to show the sharpening effect on the imagei.									(done)
	7) Histogram equlaization, show the histogram before and after the equalization.				(done)


* Machine Learning Algorithms:
	* Linear regression with Eigen and torch														(done)
	* Logistic regression with Eigen and torch


* Frequency Filtering projects:-
	1) Usef 3D-DFT to find magnitude and phase ( don't forget to pad and to shift the frequency response to be centered at (P/2, Q/2). Use log10 to show the frequency response.

* Image transformation:-
	1)  Reflection and scaling(i.e zooming in and zooming out).
	2) Rotation.
	3) Translation.
	4) Affine transformation.
